We strive to bring together the most diverse group of people possible — **we firmly believe in equality**, which is why we invite anyone and everyone to participate.

For the third time JSConf EU and CSSconf EU are offering their scholarship program, which supports **individuals from underrepresented groups** to attend [JSConf EU](http://2018.jsconf.eu/) and/or [CSSconf EU](http://2018.cssconf.eu/).

We are very grateful and would like to say a big Thank You to the companies and individuals who donate to our [Scholarship Program](https://2017.cssconf.eu/scholarships/). We were able to give away 80 tickets in 2017 and we hope to be able to invite even more people in 2018.

Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for a scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.

❤️

Granting these scholarships is made possible thanks to our [Diversity Support Tickets](https://2017.cssconf.eu/diversity-support-tickets/) initiative and the generous contributions made by our [sponsors](https://2017.cssconf.eu/sponsors). More help is needed – talk to us if you’d like to get involved: [contact@cssconf.eu](mailto:contact@cssconf.eu).
